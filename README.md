# Post-Apocalyptic-Text-based-Game
A text-based game project set in a Post-apocalyptic environment:

1. I created this as a class project and was required to develop a story description, a diagram showing the rooms and what objects were in the rooms, and pseudocode planning my code for the entire game.
2. I enjoyed this project very much and am most proud of it.

# Storyboard Description:

Bandits surround your house, and you only have a few hours before their leader, "The Ravager," leads them to break down the barricades. You need to escape the house and reach the safe zone, but before you can escape, you will need a few critical items. Youâ€™ll need a radio from the attic to signal for help, a gas mask from the basement to protect yourself from the toxic air, a pair of bolt cutters from the garage to cut through the locked gate and front door, canned food from the kitchen to keep up your strength, a flashlight from the utility room to light your way, and a handgun from the bedroom to defend yourself. Finally, you must face The Ravager in the living room, defeat him, and use the bolt cutters to break through the chained front doors and escape outside.

# The code works as follows:

1. There are 8 rooms the player can move through, the player can input: "North, South, East, and West."
2. The player starts with an empty inventory and is programmed to win the game only after collecting all necessary items from each room.
3. If the player tries to enter the Living Room where the Villian resides, WITHOUT collecting all items from each room, it will be GAME OVER.
