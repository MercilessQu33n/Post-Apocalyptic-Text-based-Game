Pseudocode for Code to “Move Between Rooms”

INITIALIZE game

SET the currentRoom to the "Office/Study"

DEFINE the rooms with their connections:

    The rooms defined are {
        "Office/Study" can only go {"West" to "Kitchen"},
        "Kitchen" can only go {"South" to "Basement" or "East" to "Office/Study"},
        "Basement" can only go {"North" to "Kitchen" or “East” to “Utility Room” or “South” to “Garage” or “West” to “Living Room”},
        "Utility Room" can only go {"North" to "Bedroom" or “West” to “Basement”},
        "Bedroom" can only go {"South" to "Utility Room"},
        "Garage" can only go {"North" to "Basement" or “East” to “Attic”}
        "Attic" can only go {"West" to "Garage"},
        "Living Room" can only go {"East" to "Basement"},
    }
